Introduction

The mtcars data present fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 car models. We do three kinds of hypothesis testing, including:
- Right-tailed t-test for the mean weight (1000 lbs.) of the cars
- Two-tailed t-test for mean qsec (Fastest time to travel 1/4 mile from standstill (in seconds))
- Left-tailed t-test of mean disp (engine displacement in cubic inches)

Conclusion

Based on the results of the above t-tests, we can summarize that there is insufficient evidence to support the claims that the average weight of cars is greater than 3000 lbs. and that the mean engine displacement is less than 250 cubic inches, with a confidence level of 95%. However, we can conclude with 99% confidence that the mean of the fastest time to travel a quarter mile from a standstill is not equal to 19.
